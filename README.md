# Practicing concepts of programming languages

## Lexical analyzer

Build a simple lexical analyzer that recognizes only arithmetic expressions, including variable names and integer literals as operands.

Assume that the variable names consist of strings of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits but must begin with a letter. Names have no length limitation. The operators recognized are: +, -, *, /, =, and parenthesis to group operations.
