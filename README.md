# Code Station

Just a place to store code while learning or practicing different concepts, languages, tools, etc.

Feel free to use whatever you need. Any suggestion, bug, or comment will always be appreciated.

Each project is available as an independent branch of this repository, and they are easily accessible through the following links.

* [lex](https://github.com/gtorres85/code_station/tree/pl-lex) - a simple lexical analyzer for arithmetic expressions (C)
* [parser](https://github.com/gtorres85/code_station/tree/pl-parser) - a simple recursive-descent parser for arithmetic expressions (C)
